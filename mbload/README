This is MBLOAD, a Multiband/Pipeline code loader based upon a public domain
xmodem program retrieved from the net.

Compiling the software:

  The software compiles and runs on SunOS 4.1.x.  It probably will work on
  other BSD UNIX variants.  To compile for a System V machine (last tested
  with System V Release 3.2) do the following:

	mv getput.c getput.bsd.c
	mv getput.sysv.c getput.c
	make

  An ANSI C compiler, gcc is selected by the Makefile, is required.  Or you
  can un-protoize the functions in mbload.c and newsend.c (about 4
  functions) and use your traditional C compiler.

Running tip:

  The program is usually run under tip.  This is the setup used at dumbcat,
  a SPARCstation 2 using ttyb connected to the multiband serial port.
  Setup on the Sparc is:

    In /dev:

	crw-rw-rw-  2 root     wheel     12,   1 Oct 12 16:04 /dev/ttyb
	crw-rw-rw-  1 uucp     uucp      12, 129 Oct 14 09:47 /dev/cua2

    In /etc/remote:

	#
	# Entries for ttyb.  This is connected to the console port of a
	# multiband.  Several bit rates are supported.  The default rate
	# is 38400.
	#
	multiband:\
	        :dv=/dev/cua2:
	mb:\
        	:br#38400:tc=multiband:
	mb19:\
        	:br#19200:tc=multiband:
	mb96:\
        	:br#9600:tc=multiband:
	mb24:\
        	:br#2400:tc=multiband:
	mb56:\
        	:br#57600:tc=multiband:

  The Multiband/Pipeline assumes it is talking to a vt100 (or an xterm), so
  it is best to run tip in a 24x80 xterm window.  The command I use
  (available from a mouse button) is:

	xterm -title VT100-MB -font fixed -rv -e tip mb&


Basic MBLOAD:

  The command line syntax is:

	mbload [-e[p]|n] [-s speed] file

  The options are:

	-e		Send escape sequence to get into the downloader

	-ep		Send the Multiband PLUS version of the escape sequence.

	-n		Send the NINDY version of the escape sequence

	-s speed	Set the bit rate of stdin and stdout to the
			specified speed.  If not specified, the current
			bit rate is used.


Running MBLOAD inside tip:

  Example: To download a Pipeline from within tip use the tip command
  "<return>~c" to cd to the directory containing the file to download.
  The use the command "<return>~C".  Tip will respond with the string
  "Local command?".  Respond with

	mbload -e mp1t1.bin

  Mbload will respond with:

	MBLOAD Version 5.0
	File mp1t1.bin
	Ready to SEND at current bit rate
	Estimated File Size 946K (967680 Bytes)
	CRC mode requested
	1K byte packets
	block 00001 r r r r r

  The Multiband and Pipeline does not erase its flash eeprom until the first
  block is received.  This typically takes a minute.  The "r" in the above
  display signifies a retry.  This is normal operation.  Once the flashed
  is erased the upload will continue at line speeds.


Running MBLOAD standalone:

  mbload can be run from the command line.  However, stdin and stdout must
  be redirected to the port connected to the Multiband/Pipeline and the
  speed will usually have to be set.  Example:

	mbload -s 38400 -n mp1t1/mp1t1.bin < /dev/cua2 > /dev/cua2
